    "The techniques in the last chapter are very powerful, but they only work with one variable or dimension. They provide no way to represent multidimensional data, such as the position and velocity of a dog in a field. Position and velocity are related to each other, and as we learned in the g-h chapter we should never throw away information. In this chapter we learn how to describe this relationship probabilistically. Through this key insight we will achieve markedly better filter performance.\n"

    "We've been using Gaussians for a scalar random variable, expressed as $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. A more formal term for this is _univariate normal_, where univariate means 'one variable'. The probability distribution of the Gaussian is known as the _univariate normal distribution_.\n",

I don't necessarily mean spatial dimensions - if we track the position, velocity, and acceleration of an aircraft in (x, y, z) that gives us a nine dimensional problem. Consider a two dimensional case. It might be the _x_ and _y_ coordinates of a robot, it might be the position and velocity of a dog on the x-axis, or milk production and feed rate at a dairy. It doesn't really matter. We can see that for $N$ dimensions, we need $N$ means, which we will arrange in a column matrix (vector) like so:\n",

If all students are the same height, then the variance is 0, and if their heights are wildly different, then the variance will be large.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a relationship between height and weight. In general, a taller person weighs more than a shorter person. Height and weight are _correlated_. We want a way to express not only what we think the variance is in the height and the weight, but also the degree to which they are correlated. In other words, we want to know how weight varies compared to the heights. We call that the _covariance_.\n",

    "## Correlation and Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "_Covariance_ describes how much two variables vary together. Covariance is short for _correlated variances_. In other words, _variance_ is a measure for how a population vary amongst themselves, and _covariance_ is a measure for how much two variables change in relation to each other. For example, as height increases weight also generally increases. These variables are _correlated_. They are _positively correlated_ because as one variable gets larger so does the other. As the outdoor temperature decreases home heating bills increase. These are _inversely correlated_ or _negatively correlated_ because as one variable gets larger the other variable lowers. The price of tea and the number of tail wags my dog makes have no relation to each other, and we say they are _uncorrelated_ or _independent_- each can change independent of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation allows prediction. If you are significantly taller than me I can predict that you also weigh more than me. As winter comes I predict that I will be spending more to heat my house. If my dog wags his tail more I don't conclude that tea prices will be changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a plot of height and weight of students on the school's track team. If a student is 68 inches tall I can predict they weigh roughly 160 pounds. Since the correlation is not perfect neither is my prediction.\n"

So, the dog has the highest probability of being near (2, 17), a modest probability of being near (5, 14), and a very low probability of being near (10, 10). As with the univariate case this is a _probability density_, not a _probability_.

It is slightly tilted, showing that there is some correlation between the position and velocity. Far more importantly, it is much smaller than either the position or velocity covariances. In the previous chapter our variance would get smaller each time we performed an `update()` because the previous estimate was multiplied by the new measurement. The same happens here. However, here the improvement is markedly better. This is because we are using two different pieces of information which are nevertheless correlated. Knowing the velocity approximately and their correlation and the position approximately allows us to make a very accurate estimate. It is not easy to see in this diagram, but the uncertainty in position has become smaller. We know this because the new covariance doesn't reach as far in the x-axis as the measurement covariance at t=1.

So long as the aircraft does not alter its velocity the velocity allows us to predict where the next position is.

Think about it - if you suddenly change direction your position is also going to change a lot.

The math does not care whether we are working with two positions, or a position and a correlated velocity, or if these are spatial dimensions. If floor space is correlated to house price you can write a Kalman filter to track house prices. If age is correlated to disease incidence you can write a Kalman filter to track diseases. If the zombie population is inversely correlated with the number of shotguns then you can write a Kalman filter to track zombie populations. I showed you this in terms of geometry and talked about _triangulation_. That was just to build your intuition. You can write a Kalman filter for state variables that have no geometric representation, such as filters for stock prices or milk production of cows (I received an email from someone tracking milk production!) Get used to thinking of these as Gaussians with correlations. If we can express our uncertainties as a multidimensional Gaussian we can then multiply the prior with the likelihood and get a much more accurate result.\n"
